# NeighborhoodMap Project

This is a project from the Udacity Javascript Nanodegree.
This is a Map app that allows the user to search and filter places, I've used Foursquare and Google Maps APIS to build this.

## Project Setup

* clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/DeltonD/Udacity_Map.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`
* start the app _ `npm start`
